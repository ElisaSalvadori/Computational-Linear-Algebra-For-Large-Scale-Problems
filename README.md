# Computational-Linear-Algebra-For-Large-Scale-Problems

This is my repository for the 'Computational Linear Algebra For Large Scale Problems' class. 

- HW_FREE.ipynb: a Jupyter Notebook file containing some techniques useful in image processing.
- HW_pca.ypinb: a Jupyter Notebook file for the analysis of a motorcycle dataset (dataset located at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wsjbEWbSUrdqbRezbiovVy3S85A1aHkN?usp=sharing).
- SC.mlx: a MATLAB Live Script file which contains an implementation of the Spectral Clustering algorithm and some examples (datasets located at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zXT6ZakBbhhM9e614vxWolFcuayT6vSg?usp=sharing).
- HW_SC.pdf: a pdf which contains a technical report about the results and the implementation.
